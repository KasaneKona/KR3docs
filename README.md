# KR3 Docs
KORG R3 technical documentation and reverse engineering

This is part of a project to reverse-engineer, and potentially emulate, the KORG R3 synthesizer.

To comply with KORG licensing, the reverse-engineering will not make use of any software or firmware relating to the synthesizer. Everything here has been figured out from fiddling with the synthesizer directly and analyzing the output, and from documentation supplied by KORG (either publicly online or via the included CD-ROM).

----
Due to the nature of old products and the tendency for documentation to eventually disappear or become difficult to find, documentation PDFs and a full CD-ROM image are hosted here for ***archival purposes only*** (see: abandonware).
